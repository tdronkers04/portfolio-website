                    I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area but have called Colorado
                    home since 2013. I&#39;m a husband and father of two boys. When I&#39;m not
                    coding or chasing my kids around, you can often find me outdoors, hopefully
                    riding a snowboard üèÇ or bike üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Although when the 49ers are playing, I&#39;m
                    probably yelling at my TV üòÖ. If you enjoy Hunter S. Thompson&#39;s writing
                    I bet we would be fast friends!

                    Nothing energizes me more than building things that people find useful.
                    I care deeply about the end-user and get inspired by any opportunity to
                    make the user experince or workflow better, if only incrementally.
                    I&#39;m at my best when tackling big, hairy problems alongside colleagues.
                    When time permits, I love exploring and tinkering with new technologies!
